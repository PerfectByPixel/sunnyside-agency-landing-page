## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In CSS, it is important for utility classes to be placed in the correct order in the style file. CSS establishes a hierarchy of styles based on the order of rule definitions - rules defined later take precedence over previously defined ones if they have the same or higher specificity of selectors.
